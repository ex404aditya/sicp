# SICP

SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) is a masterpiece of
Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman on basics of computer science and software engineering.

This is a series of of code exercises I will be doing out of the the book SICP (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) , this is going to be the first of the many books I will be solving in my future programming endevours.

Choosing the Lisp version of the book holds special significance for me. By studying programming literature from its early days, i hope to actualize the thought process of the formative years.

This is a self imposed learning structure tailored to my personal goals. I do not endorse other to follow this repo.

### Goal

My goal is to

  * Read the [SICP book](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book.html)
  * Watch the [MIT 6.001 course](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/) videos
  * Do exercises from the book
  * Keep track of my progress
